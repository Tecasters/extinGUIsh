# extinGUIsh

Wildfire simulator in Rust. Sort of similar rules to Conway's game of life. Currently, the first phase of the project is underway.

### First phase
-  determining the simulation parameters (no DEM at this point)
-  coding the bare-minimum logic
-  CLI

### Second phase
-  GUI
-  coding variations on the logic

### Third phase
-  add support for custom DEM as input
-  add layers to see either DEM or wildfire spread

### Fourth phase
-  firefighters/extinguishers
-  adjustable animation speed
